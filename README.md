Dataset Description Report
Dataset size: 
The dataset contains a total of 50,000 instances (or rows) and 1 feature of reviews data (or columns) and 1 sentiments information in positive and negative.
Data sources:
The dataset was collected from IMDB movies reviews, which people may express their opinions and rating about the movies. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/lakshmi25npathi/sentiment-analysis-of-imdb-movie-reviews/input
Target variable: 
The sentiment or opinion of each occurrence is the goal variable for this sentiment analysis dataset. With various values like positive or negative, it is shown as a categorical variable.
Text preprocessing: 
Many preparation processes were carried out to get the text data ready for sentiment analysis. For instance, all text could be made lowercase, punctuation, stop words, and non-alphanumeric letters could be eliminated, and words could be stemmed.
Text representation: 
Many methods were utilized, including word embedding and other methods of natural language processing, to represent the text data quantitatively.
Class distribution:
The class distribution of the dataset may be unbalanced, with one sentiment category occurring more frequently than others. This should be considered during model training and assessment since it may impact the sentiment analysis model's performance.
Feature correlation: 
The text characteristics and other features in the dataset could be correlated. For instance, the author or the date a piece was uploaded may have an impact on its emotion. Knowing these relationships can assist the sentiment analysis model's accuracy.
Missing values: 
The dataset may contain missing values, which can affect the performance of the sentiment analysis model. Various techniques such as imputation or removal can be used to handle missing values.
